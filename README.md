# verilog
misc verilog code

# f_divide 
frequency divider using triangular progression to get wider range of output from same number of pins as typical divider

# bcd
converts binary number to 3 digit BCD for use with 7 segment displays

# divider
divides incoming frequency by rate and then by 2. Outputs current division count for daisychaining

# seven_seg
driver for displaying BCD on 7 segment display

# rotary_enc
driver for reading rotary encoder. Also outputs a pulse on value update. Clock input should be 10kHz or less
